# CShell

Attention!!!

Please, be patient, because I'm studying...

This work was so hard for me. That's result of my learning low-level programming.

That's my shell on C programming language. It's can execute a bash commands like a Unix-shell.

---

## Using
Clone repo. There's a Makefile inside this. 

Basic commands:
- to clean trash
```bash
make clean
```
- to build project
```bash
make
```
- to run
```bash
./solution
```

After running you can type your shell-commands.

### Examples
```bash
echo 1 > f
```
```bash
ls -l | sort
```
```bash
ip ; echo 3 2 1 > f
```
As you can see, all typical commands are working well.
